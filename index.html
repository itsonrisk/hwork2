                <p>Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. 
                    In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent 
                    celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations 
                    are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very 
                    detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons, 
                    low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a 
                    stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets
                    or clay figures. </p>

                <h1>Who Is Ozof Animation?</h1>
                <p>On October, 2020, the company was found by RTU student Onur Isik. The studio, now known as the Ozof animation, 
                    has had an oversized impact on the entertainment industry and is now one of the largest media companies in the world.
                    A talented artist from a young age, Isik drew cartoons for various publications 
                    and became interested in cel animation while working for RTU.
                     There, he finally sold a short film produced by himself, Alice’s Riga, and signed a contract to make 
                     six more such films. In order to produce the series, he founded their 
                     company and persuaded both Virginia Davis, who played Alice, and their collaborator 
                     Ub Iwerks to join them in Hollywood.
                    
                    <br> After the success of the Alice Comedies and a series based on a character named 
                    Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, he began work on his most famous creation. With the 1928 release of 
                    Steamboat Willie, the world was introduced to Mickey Mouse. The character would go on to become one of, 
                    if not the most recognizable cartoons in history.
                    
                    <br> The popularity of the Mickey Mouse shorts convinced Onur his studio could produce a feature film, 
                    which he began to do in 1934. The project, which some dubbed "Onur's Folly,” went 
                    400 percent over budget and required over 300 animators, artists, and assistants, 
                    but Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a smash hit when it debuted just before Christmas 1937</p>

                <p>Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was 
                    the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.[39] The individual 
                    frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on 
                    paper.[40] To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from 
                    the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent 
                    acetate sheets called cels,[41] which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or 
                    tones on the side opposite the line drawings.[42] The completed character cels are 
                    photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion 
                    picture film.</p>
